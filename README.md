Fitness Tracking and Heath consciousness has arguable grown to become a ost-covid cultural but it is not only an in-vogue thing to do, it can be a great way to live a healthy life. However, anyone that has tried to build a consistent exercise of healthy habit will know (remember new year wave of fitness goals), you need all the supporting environment you can get. Many companies like Bellabeat are already forging ahead to make the decisions about everyone’s health a smart weaable away,.
I recently assumed the role of Bellabeats Data Analyst in the Marketing department. The wearables market has been growning since 2016, to reach 30B dollars in the latest figure in 2022. This growth curve and uptake in this market is exactly what Bellabeat CEO needed my skills for.
Bellabeat has been a successful small company, in the global smart device market. This market growth resented it with the potential to become a larger player and the company management now believes that analyzing smart device fitness data could help unlock new growth opportunities for the company. I have therefore been asked to focus on one of Bellabeat’s products and analyze the smart device data to gain insight into how consumers are using their smart devices. The insights I discover and the high-level recommendations will then help guide marketing strategy for the company. 

From this, I figured 

What Bellabeat really wanted!
1.	The company wants more market share in the global smart device market.
2.	We want our product to be the one meeting users' needs.  
3.	We want them to know our products is the one that can meet their needs 
What they really want to do!

Bellabeat wanted to reduce uncertainty in the businesses decisions on their marketing strategies, by knowing
1.	What the terrain and characteristics of the market are?
2.	What seems to be needed?
3.	How they seem to be receptive?
4.	What can confidence have confidence in from how it has worked or how it will work?
5.	How the we best execute what is most probable to work?
